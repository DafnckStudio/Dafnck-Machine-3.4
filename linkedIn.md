ðŸ”„ dhafnck_mcp_main - Cursor Agent Task Management Project

ðŸš€ dhafnck_mcp_main MCP
I'm excited to share dhafnck_mcp_main - a real-world case study of migrating a complex cursor agent system from custom architecture to the modern Model Context Protocol standard using FastMCP 2.0.
ðŸ“ˆ The Migration Journey:
FROM: Custom cursor_agent system with proprietary protocols
TO: FastMCP 2.0-based architecture with standardized MCP integration
ðŸ”¥ What This Migration Achieved:
âœ… Modernized Architecture - Moved from custom protocols to MCP standard
âœ… Enhanced Scalability - Leveraged FastMCP's production-ready infrastructure
âœ… Maintained Functionality - Preserved all existing agent capabilities
âœ… Improved Integration - Seamless LLM connectivity with standardized interfaces
âœ… Production Ready - Complete deployment guides and testing frameworks

ðŸ’¡ Perfect Blueprint For:
Teams migrating legacy AI systems to modern standards
Organizations adopting MCP protocol architecture
Developers modernizing custom agent frameworks
Engineering teams scaling AI infrastructure

Tech Stack: Python 3.10+, FastMCP 2.0, MCP Protocol, Legacy cursor_agent Integration
