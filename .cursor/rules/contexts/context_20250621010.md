# TASK CONTEXT: Verification Task for `manage_subtask` fix

**Task ID**: `20250621010`
**Assignee**: `[]` (Unassigned)
**Status**: `todo`
**Priority**: `medium`

## 1. Objective

A temporary verification task created to validate the fix for the `manage_subtask` MCP tool. This task serves as a testing ground to ensure that all documented subtask management actions work correctly after the bug fix implementation.

## 2. Background Context

This verification task was created in response to the critical bug identified in task `20250621009`, where the `manage_subtask` MCP tool was failing to recognize valid actions like `update_subtask` and `remove_subtask`. The bug has been fixed, and this task serves to validate the solution.

## 3. Verification Requirements

### Actions to Test:
- [ ] `add_subtask` - Add new subtask to a task
- [ ] `complete_subtask` - Mark subtask as completed
- [ ] `update_subtask` - Modify subtask properties
- [ ] `remove_subtask` - Remove subtask from task
- [ ] `list_subtasks` - List all subtasks for a task

### Test Scenarios:
1. **Basic Functionality**: Each action executes without errors
2. **Data Integrity**: Subtask operations maintain data consistency
3. **Parent Task Updates**: Subtask changes properly update parent task progress
4. **Error Handling**: Invalid operations return appropriate error messages

## 4. Technical Validation

### MCP Tool Handler Validation:
```python
# Test all manage_subtask actions
test_actions = [
    "add_subtask",
    "complete_subtask", 
    "update_subtask",
    "remove_subtask",
    "list_subtasks"
]

for action in test_actions:
    result = manage_subtask(action=action, task_id="test_task", subtask_data={...})
    assert result["success"] == True
```

### Integration Points:
- [ ] MCP server action validation
- [ ] Task management application services
- [ ] Data persistence layer
- [ ] Parent task progress calculation
- [ ] Subtask lifecycle management

## 5. Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements:
- [ ] All subtask actions execute successfully
- [ ] No "Unknown subtask action" errors
- [ ] Subtask data persists correctly
- [ ] Parent task progress updates accurately
- [ ] Error handling works as expected

### Integration Requirements:
- [ ] MCP tool integration functional
- [ ] Application service layer working
- [ ] Data consistency maintained
- [ ] Multi-agent orchestration unblocked

## 6. Dependencies

**Related to**: Task 20250621009 - [BUG] `manage_subtask` MCP tool fix
**Part of**: EPIC 20250621001 - Complete task_mcp module migration
**Blocks**: Multi-agent orchestration workflows that depend on subtask management

## 7. Testing Approach

### Manual Testing:
1. Create a test task
2. Add subtasks using `add_subtask` action
3. Update subtask details using `update_subtask` action
4. Complete subtasks using `complete_subtask` action
5. Remove subtasks using `remove_subtask` action
6. List all subtasks using `list_subtasks` action

### Validation Points:
- [ ] Each action returns success response
- [ ] Subtask data is correctly stored and retrieved
- [ ] Parent task progress reflects subtask completion
- [ ] Removed subtasks are properly cleaned up
- [ ] Error cases handle gracefully

## 8. Expected Outcomes

### Positive Test Results:
- All documented actions work without errors
- Subtask operations maintain data integrity
- Parent task progress calculations are accurate
- MCP tool responses are properly formatted

### Resolution Confirmation:
- Original bug symptoms no longer present
- "Unknown subtask action" error eliminated
- Orchestration workflows can proceed normally
- Multi-agent coordination unblocked

## 9. Cleanup

### Post-Verification:
- [ ] Remove test data created during verification
- [ ] Document verification results
- [ ] Update task status based on test outcomes
- [ ] Close verification task if successful

### If Issues Found:
- [ ] Document specific failure cases
- [ ] Report back to original bug task (20250621009)
- [ ] Provide detailed error information for debugging
- [ ] Keep verification task open until issues resolved

## 10. Notes

This is a temporary task created specifically for validating the `manage_subtask` bug fix. Once verification is complete and all subtask actions are confirmed working, this task can be marked as complete and removed from the active task list.

The verification process is critical for ensuring that the multi-agent orchestration workflows can proceed without the blocking issue that was preventing programmatic subtask modification.
