## 🎯 Objective
Test that project_id is correctly used in task operations and storage to ensure proper project isolation and functionality.

## 📋 Requirements
- [x] Verify project_id is correctly used in all task operations
- [x] Test cross-project isolation
- [x] Validate task storage separation by project_id
- [x] Confirm task listing works properly per project

## 🔧 Technical Details
### Technologies/Frameworks
- MCP Server dhafnck_mcp
- Hierarchical task storage system
- Cross-project validation

### Key Files/Directories
- `.cursor/rules/tasks/default_id/dhafnck_mcp_main/`
- `.cursor/rules/tasks/default_id/proj1/`
- Task management MCP operations

### Dependencies
- Depends on: 20250625001 (main test task)

## 🚀 Progress Tracking
### Completed Actions
- [x] Created test task in different project (proj1) - 2025-06-25 - coding_agent
- [x] Verified task storage isolation - 2025-06-25 - coding_agent
- [x] Validated project_id functionality in operations - 2025-06-25 - coding_agent

### Current Session Summary
Successfully validated project_id functionality by creating tasks in different projects and confirming proper isolation. Storage paths correctly separated by project_id.

### Next Steps
- [x] Task completed successfully

## 🔍 Context Notes
### Agent Insights
- Project_id isolation working perfectly - tasks stored in separate directories
- Cross-project operations do not interfere with each other
- Task counts and file sizes confirm proper separation

### Challenges Encountered
- None - functionality worked as expected

### Solutions Applied
- Created test task in proj1 to validate cross-project isolation
- Used filesystem verification to confirm proper separation
