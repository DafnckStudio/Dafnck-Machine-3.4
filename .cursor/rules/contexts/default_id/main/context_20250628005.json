RuleComposer component implementation\n2. Intelligent rule merging algorithms\n3. compose_rules action for MCP tool\n4. Advanced conflict resolution strategies\n5. Rule precedence and priority systems\n6. Composition validation and testing\n\n**Technical Requirements:**\n- Combine multiple rule sources intelligently\n- Implement merge strategies (merge, override, append)\n- Detect and resolve rule conflicts automatically\n- Support rule precedence and priority systems\n- Validate composed rule integrity\n- Provide composition preview and rollback\n- Support custom composition rules and policies\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Successfully compose rules from multiple sources\n- Automatically resolve 80%+ of rule conflicts\n- Maintain rule integrity after composition\n- Support complex composition scenarios\n- Provide clear composition audit trails\n- 95%+ test coverage for composition logic"
