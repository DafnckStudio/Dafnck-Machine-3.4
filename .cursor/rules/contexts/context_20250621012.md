# TASK CONTEXT: Integrate Task Management with FastMCP Server

**Task ID**: `20250621012`
**Status**: `done`
**Priority**: `high`
**Assignee**: `@system_architect_agent`
**Created**: `2025-06-21T18:00:01.284376`
**Last Updated**: `2025-06-22T00:03:43.615875`

## 🎯 Objective
Integrate the migrated task management module with the main FastMCP server architecture to expose task management capabilities through the unified server interface.

## 📋 Requirements
- [x] Analyze current FastMCP server architecture
- [x] Identify integration points for task management
- [x] Update server initialization to include task management routes
- [x] Ensure proper error handling and middleware integration
- [x] Test server startup and functionality

## 🔧 Technical Details
### Technologies/Frameworks
- FastMCP framework
- FastAPI
- MCP (Model Context Protocol)
- Python async/await

### Key Files/Directories
- `dhafnck_mcp_main/src/fastmcp/server/server.py`
- `dhafnck_mcp_main/src/fastmcp/server/dependencies.py`
- `dhafnck_mcp_main/src/fastmcp/server/http_server.py`
- `dhafnck_mcp_main/src/fastmcp/dhafnck_mcp/`

### Dependencies
- Dependency on Interface Layer Migration (Phase 5)
- Requires task management module to be fully migrated

## 🚀 Progress Tracking
### Completed Actions
- [x] Server architecture analysis - 2025-06-22 - @system_architect_agent
- [x] Integration points identification - 2025-06-22 - @system_architect_agent
- [x] Server initialization updates - 2025-06-22 - @system_architect_agent
- [x] Error handling and middleware integration - 2025-06-22 - @system_architect_agent
- [x] Server functionality testing - 2025-06-22 - @system_architect_agent

### Current Session Summary
Successfully integrated the task management module with the main FastMCP server. The integration includes:
1. Updated server configuration to include task management routes
2. Proper error handling and middleware integration
3. Maintained compatibility with existing FastMCP functionality
4. Verified server startup and task management endpoint functionality

### Next Steps
- [x] Task completed successfully
- [x] Integration verified and tested
- [x] All acceptance criteria met

## 🔍 Context Notes
### Agent Insights
The integration required careful consideration of the existing FastMCP server architecture to ensure seamless integration without breaking existing functionality. The task management module was successfully integrated as a unified component of the server.

### Challenges Encountered
- Ensuring compatibility between the migrated task management module and existing FastMCP server structure
- Proper error handling and middleware integration across different components
- Maintaining server startup performance with additional task management functionality

### Solutions Applied
- Implemented proper dependency injection patterns for task management services
- Updated server initialization sequence to include task management components
- Added comprehensive error handling and logging for task management operations
- Verified integration through comprehensive testing of server functionality
